Special thanks to youtube.com/TheCherno for making this project possible.

Getting Started
Visual Studio 2017 or latest is recommended.

1. Downloading the repository:

Start by cloning the repository with git clone --recursive https://github.com/LarsSeverson/Meadow.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use git submodule update --init to clone the necessary submodules.

2. Configuring the dependencies:

Run the GenerateProject file. This will download the required prerequisites for the project if they are not present yet.
