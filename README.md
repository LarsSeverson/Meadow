This project is a programming environment designed to help developers experiment and explore the capabilities of the OpenGL graphics rendering API. The project provides a robust and extensible framework for creating and manipulating OpenGL objects, such as textures, shaders, and buffers, and allows developers to write custom code to interact with these objects. Currently available only on Microsoft Visual Studio.

Instructions: Start by cloning the project with --recursive. Next, simply run the Windows .bat file
